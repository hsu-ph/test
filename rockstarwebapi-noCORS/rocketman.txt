<p class='verse'>Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids<br>
In fact it's cold as hell<br>
And there's no one there to raise them if you did<br>
And all this science, I don't understand<br>
It's just my job five days a week<br>
A rocket man, a rocket man</p><p class='verse'>And I think it's gonna be a long, long time<br>
Till touch down brings me round again to find<br>
I'm not the man they think I am at home<br>
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man<br>
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone</p><p class='verse'>And I think it's gonna be a long, long time<br>
Till touch down brings me round again to find<br>
I'm not the man they think I am at home<br>
Oh no no no, I'm a rocket man<br>
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone</p>
